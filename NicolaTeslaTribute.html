                    <li><span><strong>1887: Tesla re-imagines the Electric Motor.</strong>&nbsp;Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by alternating current, a form of power that was becoming common in Europe and USA -- providing various benefits, especially in long-distance power transmission.</span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>1890: Tesla begins his work on wireless power transmission.</strong>&nbsp;Tesla spent over a decade trying to come up with new solutions for lighting. After 1980, he researched various approaches to transmitting power by inductive and capactive coupling.</span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>1891: Tesla patents the Tesla Coil.</strong>&nbsp;By the age of 35, he became a citizen of the US. In the same year, he also patended his famous Tesla coil.</span></li>
